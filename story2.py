S00001 = SM_01.name+''' brought the sword around in a downward slash, bifurcating the target drone in a flurry of sparks, the image of a cultist being projected by it momentarily
showing the simulated injury of having been sliced from left shoulder to right hip before flickering out of existence.'''
S00002a = '''Allowing the momentum of the motion to carry him through a half turn, '+SM_01.name+' ducked down to avoid a blow from another cultist, the momentum of the attackers
failed charge causing him to move off balance for a moment.'''
S00002b = 'The momentum of the motion pulled '+SM_01.name+''' off balance for just a moment, forcing him to correct his stance. It was only at the last moment that he saw that a
second cultist was moving to strike him with some manner of improvised weapon.'''
S00003a = SM_01.name+''' centered his body mass just in time to drop his left shoulder and use that as a counter weight to bring his right hand around in a punch targeted on the
cultist\'s head.'''
S00003b = SM_01.name+''' struggled to dodge the cultists attack, staggering as he found his footing off center. He was rewarded by a resonating thunk as the cultists improvised
club connected with his helmet.'''
S00004a = 'His punch connected squarely with the targeting drone the hologram of the cultist was being projected on, the cogitator array quickly calculating the extent of the damage.'
S00004b = SM_01.name+' mailed fist sailed by the cultists head, the tip of the hilt only just grazing its check. '+SM_01.name+' silently cursed.'
S00005a = 'The cogitator calculated that the force of '+SM_01.name+'\'s punch sent the cultist sprawling onto his back, and the holographic cultist was modified accordingly.'
S00005b = 'The cogitator array powering the simulation quickly calculated that the force of '+SM_01.name+'\'s punch was sufficient to not only send the cultist sprawling backwards, but to also lift them off their feet before they landed on their back.'
S00005c = 'The cogitator array powering the simulation quickly calculated that the force of '+SM_01.name+'\'s punch was sufficient to not only send the cultist sprawling backwards, but to also shatter bone on the cultists head in addition to sending them sprawling backward. The holographic representation of the cultist was updated to reflect the injury and the condition.'
S00005d = 'The cogitator array powering the simulation quickly calculated that the force of '+SM_01.name+'\'s punch was sufficient to not only send the cultist sprawling backwards, but to actually fracture and splinter the cultists skull, crushing his brain and killing him out right. The holographic projection was updated to reflect the status, showing the head deforming, followed by the skin ripping apart to let the simulated blood flow freely for a moment before the cogitator computed that the cultist would actually be dead.'
S00005e = 'The improvised axe skidded across '+SM_01.name+'\'s helmet failing to inflict any notable damage. '
S00005f = 'The improvised axe slammed against '+SM_01.name+'\'s helmet right against the joint of his neck. His vision grew dark as the cogitator array calculated that it would have been a lethal strike and was shutting down the simulation in accordance with that result. '+SM_01.name+' sighed at he stood up, knowing that he was due for a dressing down from Watch Captain '+SM_05.name+'.'
S00006a = SM_01.name+' quickly whipped his sword around to strike at the second cultists, '
s00006b = SM_01.name+' turned to face the second cultist, just in time to see him hefting his pipe weapon to strike'
S00007a = 'The ringing in his ears brought on a moment of anger for '+SM_01.name+'. He clenched his fist around the handle of his sword, and drove it at the cultist. The blade passed through the torso of the hologram, skipping off the surface of the targeting drone. The Cogitator array calculcated the result of the attack being a kill shot, and shut down the drone, the holograph vanishing like the morning mist. '
S00007b = SM_01.name+' rammed his sword at the offending cultist, the blade passing through the rags and cloth of its clothing, but failing to land any damage on the cultist itself.'
S00007c = 'the blade catching the cultist at a moment when it had just been raising it\'s weapon to attack '+SM_01.name+'. His strength carried the blade through the hologram, the cogitator array quickly calculating that he had landed a killing blow and updated the projection accordingly.'
S00007d = 'the blade coming to surprising halt as it clashed with heft of the cultists pipe weapon. '+SM_01.name+' looked at the cultist in surprise.'
S00008a = 'He was shocked that the cogitator array had calculated that the cultist would have been able to stop his strike. But no matter, he powered through a follow up attack, shoving his elbow into the cultist, knocking the cultist off their feet through an act of raw strength.'
S00008b = 'To compound his shock, the cultist willing fell back using '+SM_01.name+'\'s own strength to move himself out of the direction of his attack. The Cogitator was evidently attempting to make this a particularly challenging cultist, or perhaps Watch Captain '+SM_05.name+' had something to do with it. It didn\'t matter as '+SM_01.name+' followed through behind the deflected attack with a followup of bringing his left fist around and connecting a punch with the cultists chest.'
S00008c = ''
S00008d = ''
S00008e = SM_01.name+' drew his sword back across the Cultists torso, the force fields meant to simulate matter producing some resistance to his attack, but he powered through it with his gen-enhanced strength. The Cogitator array calculated the lethal damage to the cultist, updating the holographic display to coincide with the damage a real cultists would have just suffered, in this case the damage being a split torso. The targeting drone the hologram was projected around deactived and came to a rest on the ground as the hologram vanished.'
