demography ='''Hot/Temperate, abiding planetary climate is
tropical with a low degree of precipitation and storm activity. The planet has
two main continental landmasses. Each are dominated by arid plains and rain
forest zones surrounding a chain of large mountain ranges. The equatorial
regions are made up of bands of deserts. The planet also possesses relatively
small polar oceans.'''

governor='Not yet determined'
adept='Initial/Low; the Ecclesiarchy and Imperial Guard have small stations set up on the planet’s main continent.'
military='The Aurum tribes have a primitive force of infantry and cavalry (roughly two regiments of each), nominally commanded by the Caele.'
trade='''Aurum is rich in promethium deposits and the rare decavane crystals (see below). In addition to its abundant natural resources, the planet is strategically well-suited to the needs of the Crusade and the Aurum tribes themselves are a fierce warrior culture that is nearly ideal for integration into the Imperial Guard.'''
codex='''Aurum derives its name from the golden glow that suffuses its atmosphere. If it contained so mundane a resource as
actual gold ore, it would be of interest only to reckless Rogue Traders willing to risk the untamed Jericho Reach to
exploit it. However, Aurum is rich in a far rarer and more immediately useful resource than metal. The unique amber
colour suffusing the sky and tinting the planet originates from its rare Decavane crystals. Decavane crystals can hold an
exponentially larger charge than standard crystal batteries, making them highly valued for alternate weapon patterns
and other military equipment.
The relationship between the crystals and Aurum’s environment, if any, is unclear, but it is obvious the planet is
exceptionally resource-rich and fertile. Nearly every form of flora prospers when introduced to the rich soil, and herd
animals mature quickly and free of illness. Even the native population has grown strong and able on this unusually
healthy planet, although the native predators are equally flourishing and the Aurans must strive constantly to perfect
their martial skills to keep pace with them.) Some have theorised that the Decavane crystals emit a subtle, beneficial
energy field, while others propose that they are the effect and not the cause of some undiscovered property of the planet.
Until the natives allow the Adeptus Mechanicus to perform detailed research, scholars can only conjecture.
Imperial Roots
For their part, the Aurans attribute their planet’s benevolence to the “Soul of Aurum,” a male personification of the
planet’s will. This Soul actually has striking similarities to the God-Emperor—from his creation of 20 sons and their
armies to a betrayal by his most beloved child. Their religious parables likewise show roots in the Imperial Creed. The
original date of human habitation can only be guessed at, but the low gothic dialect and various cultural artefacts clearly
indicate an Imperial history.
Culture
Combat is an Auran way of life, encompassing all ages and genders. In the planet’s past, scattered tribes warred for
dominance. The tribes have been united for several centuries, but the planet’s predators ensure that martial prowess
remains a necessity. As a result, while the Aurans do farm the fertile land and raise herd animals, traditional hunts
remains a staple of their culture. The society has not yet developed currency; they rely on a barter system.
The traditional Auran greeting is to touch one’s weapon’s hilt to the other party’s shoulder. Non-lethal martial
challenges are used to solve nearly any disagreement, from domestic quarrels to trade disputes. If a matter escalates to
a serious grudge, the natives have a tradition called “splitting the rock of grievance.” 
Aurum’s plains make wood an uncommon commodity, and it is unclear if metal ore even exists on the planet. The
natives show a relatively advanced understanding of farming and medicine, but their implements tend to be made of
rock and bone.'''
